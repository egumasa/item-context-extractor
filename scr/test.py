example = '''The argument - that the temporal extension of transformations causes a separation of intellect from visceral awareness - seems , then , worthy of some consideration We take ourselves , that is away from the embodied understanding of what might be possible and move , instead , towards a less physical awareness - the stuff of intellectual ruminating . What may have been a cathartic ( even religious ) inversion of the everyday becomes over time the ongoing fabric of our psychological disabilities , and our hope for creating something new gets similarly warped into a " pathological manifestation " - one that we learn to describe through the controlled rhetoric of depth psychology .'''
